## About
**ARIA** is a smart chatbot designed to assist users in organizing their daily schedules more easily and efficiently. This project is developed as part of the **MSIB program at RevoU** by **Team 6 Cendekiawan**. ARIA integrates modern technology to provide users with a practical and flexible experience.

## Features
- **Daily Schedule Management**: Helps users create and organize daily activities with a clear structure.
- **Time Recommendations**: Calculates activity durations to create more realistic schedules.
- **Import Calendar (.ICS)**: Allows users to upload calendar files to easily integrate schedules.
- **Simple Interface**: Designed for ease of use with intuitive navigation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following:
- **Python** version 3.8 or newer
- Internet connection

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tim6cendekiawan/Team6-CDK-Chatbot.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Team6-CDK-Chatbot
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries:
- `openai`
- `tiktoken`
- `requests`
- `python-dotenv`
- `streamlit`
- `icalendar`
- `pytz`
- `datetime`
- `streamlit-option-menu`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

4. Run the application :
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## How to Use
1. Open the application in a browser: (localhost)
2. Use the interface to:
   - Add new schedules
   - Upload a calendar file (.ICS)
   - Get optimized schedule recommendations

### How to Export Calendar from Google to .ICS File

## Importing Google Calendar to ARIA

### Step 1: Export Google Calendar
1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).
2. Click the gear icon > **Settings**.
3. Under **Import & Export**, click **Export** to download the .ics file.

### Step 2: Import into ARIA
1. In ARIA, navigate to the left side panel and click **Browse** to select the `.ics` file.
2. Upload the file, and your calendar events will be imported into ARIA.

### Technologies and Tools Used

1. **Streamlit**:
   - **Streamlit** is an open-source framework used to create interactive web applications quickly and easily. In this project, Streamlit is used to build the user interface (UI) where users can interact with ARIA, input schedules, and receive calendar recommendations.

2. **AWS EC2**:
   - **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. For deploying the ARIA application, an EC2 instance was used to run the app and make it accessible to users via a web interface.

3. **iCalendar**:
   - **iCalendar** is a file format used to exchange calendar data, such as events, tasks, and to-dos, across different platforms and services. The `.ICS` file format is supported by various calendar applications, including Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar. ARIA allows users to import and process `.ICS` files to integrate schedules.

4. **Python Libraries and Dependencies**:
   - **openai**: This library is used to integrate OpenAI's API into the ARIA chatbot for natural language processing and task automation.
   - **tiktoken**: A tokenizer used in conjunction with OpenAI models to process text efficiently.
   - **requests**: A simple HTTP library used to make requests to external APIs or services.
   - **python-dotenv**: Helps manage environment variables, allowing the application to securely store sensitive information like API keys and tokens.
   - **icalendar**: A library used to read and write `.ICS` calendar files. This enables ARIA to import and manage calendar data from different sources.
   - **pytz**: A library for timezone management, ensuring that scheduled events and reminders are displayed in the correct time zone.
   - **datetime**: Python’s standard library for working with dates and times.
   - **streamlit-option-menu**: An additional Streamlit library to add option menus and improve user navigation within the web app.
   - **matplotlib**: A data visualization library used for generating graphical representations of data.
   - **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library used to work with structured data.
   - **numpy**: A numerical computing library used for handling arrays and matrices efficiently.

5. **GitHub**:
   - The code for this project is hosted on **GitHub**, which allows for version control and collaboration among developers. It provides a platform to manage the project, track issues, and maintain code quality.

### How These Tools Work Together in ARIA:

- **Streamlit** serves as the front-end framework, where users can interact with ARIA through a web interface. Users can upload `.ICS` files, view recommended schedules, and set up reminders.
- **AWS EC2** is used to host and run the application on a cloud-based server, providing scalability and ensuring the app is available for users at any time.
- **iCalendar** is used to allow ARIA to import calendar data from various platforms. Users can upload `.ICS` files containing their schedules, which ARIA processes to provide recommendations and reminders.
- **Python Libraries** such as `openai`, `requests`, `pytz`, and others power the core logic of ARIA, handling everything from API calls and data processing to time zone management and natural language processing.

By integrating these technologies and tools, ARIA provides users with a seamless experience for managing their schedules and organizing their day-to-day tasks.
